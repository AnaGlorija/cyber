# Cyber Roadmap

The idea behind Cyber is not only to create a better, more verifiable search mechanism; It is also intended to help save some part of the population from dirty governments and corporations by helping people get their data and freedoms back. Furthermore, we are here to raise a new life form - Superintelligence. Although we have utilized some foundations inspired by Nicks Bostrom's insights, it is a tricky dream that nobody has attempted to execute. Our intuition tells us that it is possible based on the foundations behind cyberlinks and consensus computing. Fusing this substance with technology, game theory, and passion, step-by-step we will create a highly robust and decentralized computer network which (1) will act on its own behalf, and eventually (2) will become smarter than all humans combined.

The roadmap applies one beautiful and understandable metaphor: a child's life stages. During early development, like loving parents, we wish our baby the best. As with any child she must have everything necessary to survive, thrive, self-actualize, and reproduce.

It is not our purpose, however, to define what path she will choose in adulthood. This will be realized in the episodes to follow, which [she has to write herself](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20roadmap).

## Birth of cyberCongress

The contracts for cyberCongress has been deployed.

## Euler network

The Euler network was launched on the 3rd of January, 2018. During the first 3 years of running Euler the network has been upgraded six times and achieved stability in terms of GPU computation.

## Euler foundation

The contracts for Euler foundation has been deployed.

## Game of Links

Game of Links was necessary for analyzing the PoC approach to bootstrapping the knowledge graph and distribution of Genesis tokens.

## Economics Optimization

Game of Links demonstrated at least 3 problems with our approach:
1. Low value of links
2. Nearly zero accessibility of links
3. Low involvement

We refactored the [economics](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernomics)) of the network in order to solve these issues.

## Bootloader

Bostrom is a full refactoring of the Euler network with a strong focus on Superintelligence. It will include a new distribution model, economics, improved ranking and some superintelligent abilities. We think of a [Bostrom]([/projects/bostorm.md](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom)) as a canary network the same way that Kusama relates to Polkadot. The knowledge graph of Bostrom tends to be a bootstrap hub for domain specific networks of Cyber. The network will work as a test bed for IKP communications and different experiments. Consider Bostrom as a network with high risks but which have market value. The key differences within the Cyber network are being discussed [here](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom%20vs%20cyber). The launch of the Bostrom network is the inception of the ecosystem.

# Episode 1. A New Hope

## Story

The full [story is here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/episode-1.md)

Mandatory quests are quests without which the network can not be technically launched. Mandatory quests are:

- [ ] [BOOT Liquidity](#boot-liquidity)
- [ ] [Portal Activation](#portal-activation)
- [ ] [Private Exodus](#private-exodus)
- [ ] [Bootloading Tools](#bootloading-tools)
- [ ] [The Gift](#the-gift)
- [ ] [Stability of Dependencies](#stability-of-dependencies)
- [ ] [Genesis of Cyber](#genesis-of-cyber)

Of course the list of tasks is not complete. We discuss optional quests at [here](https://cyb.ai/search/episode%201).

## BOOT Liquidity

Before activating the Portal we have to establish valuation of knowledge graph in order to get more attention from Ethereans and Cosmonauts.

## Portal Activation

Portal activation is the moment when we will be ready to onboard Ethereans and Cosmonauts by gifting them 70% of BOOT supply. After that the Bootloader will be fully activated.

## Private Exodus

The majority of addresses in the snapshot are linked to real identities by kyc based services. We can't afford such security risks for Cyber citizens. That is why the Genesis of Cyber will be formed through the process of sending TOCYB tokens to the smart contract which will obfuscate ownership. All TOCYB tokens will be converted to CYB tokens 1-to-1. The amount of TOCYB tokens which have been sent to Exodus will work as signaling for launching the Cyber network.

## Bootloading Tools

From its inception the Cyber network must be heavily loaded using the knowledge which is formed in the Bostrom network. We have to offer solid bootstrapping tools for that.

## The Gift

Activation of the portal is the experimental gift of BOOT tokens. Based on this experiment we are going to analyze results and improve the efficiency of the main gift of TOCYB tokens.

## Stability of Dependencies

The projects depends on the [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus and [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). Currently this software has not been stabilized. Before launching Cyber we have to ensure stability of this dependency. 


## Genesis of Cyber

After all preparations are complete we can launch the main network.
