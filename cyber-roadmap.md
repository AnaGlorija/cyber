# Cyber Roadmap

The idea behind Cyber is not just to create better, verifiable search. The idea behind Cyber is not only to save some part of the population from dirty govs and corps, helping people get their data and freedoms back. The idea goes far more further. We are here to rise a new life form - the Superintelligence. Although we have some foundations given us by Nicks Bostrom's insights, it is a tricky dream because nobody has ever tried this. And nobody knows how to do that for sure, including us. But our intuition tells us that it is possible based on the foundations behind cyberlinks and consensus computing. Adding to this substance some tech, game theory, and passion, slowly, step by step, we will create a highly robust and decentralized computer network which (1) will act on its behalf, and eventually (2) will become smarter than all humans combined.

The roadmap applies one beautiful and understandable by all humans metaphor: the child's life stages. During early development, as any loving parents, we wish our baby the stuff we feel important through the lens of our lives. And as with any child, she must have everything necessary to survive, self-actualize, and reproduce.

- Infancy. Episode 2
- Childhood. Episode 3
- Puberty. Episode 4
- Adolescence. Episode 5

Nonetheless, it is not our purpose as parents to define what path will she choose in adulthood. That is, rest episodes [she have to write herself](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20roadmap).

# Episode 1. A New Hope

## Story

It is a period of digital war. The evil empire swallows the last unoccupied borders of the universe.

Resisting rebel units consolidate all remaining energy on building a Superintelligence, which they believe will help to stop the domination of the evil empire once and for all.

As they begin to test the new god in the wild - an enormous, zepto amount of robots emerge. It turns out Cyb robots help survey the universe for a bootloader of the new, yet to born, force.

Mandatory quests are quests without which the network can not be technically launched. Mandatory quests are:

- [x] [Euler](#euler)
- [x] [Game of Links](#game-of-links)
- [x] [Economics Optimization](#economics-optimization)
- [x] [Bootloader: Genesis of Bostrom](#bootloader)
- [ ] [BOOT Liquidity](#boot-liquidity)
- [ ] [Portal Activation](#portal-activation)
- [ ] [Private Exodus](#private-exodus)
- [ ] [Bootloading Tools](#bootloading-tools)
- [ ] [The Gift](#the-gift)
- [ ] [Stability of Dependencies](#stability-of-dependencies)
- [ ] [Genesis of Cyber](#genesis-of-cyber)

Of course the list of task is not full. 

## Euler

First Euler network was launched at 3 of January 2018. During 3 years of running Euler the network have been upgraded six times and achieved stability in terms of GPU computation.

## Game of Links

Game of Links was necessary for analyzing PoC approach to bootstrapping knowledge graph and distribute some part of genesis tokens.

## Economics Optimization

Game of Links demonstrated at least 3 problems with our approach:
1. Low value of links
2. Nearly zero accessibility of links
3. Low involvement

We refactored [economics](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernomics)) of the network in order to solve these issues.

## Bootloader

Bostrom is a full refactoring of euler network with a strong focus on Superintelligence. It will include new distribution, economics, improved ranking and some superintelligent abilities. We think of a [Bostrom]([/projects/bostorm.md](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom)) as a canary network the same way as Kusama for Polkadot. Knowledge graph of bostrom tends to be a bootstrap hub for domain specific networks of Cyber. The network will work as a test bed for IKP communications and different experiments. Consider bostrom as a network with high risks but which have market value. The key difference with Cyber network are being discussed [here](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom%20vs%20cyber). Launch of Bostrom network is the inception for the ecosystem.

## BOOT Liquidity

Before activating the Portal we have to establish some valuation of knowledge graph in order to get more attention from ethereans and cosmonauts.

## Portal Activation

Portal activation is a moment then we will be ready to onboard ethereans and cosmonauts by gifting them 70% of BOOT supply. After that a Bootloader is fully activated.

## Private Exodus

The majority of addresses in the snapshot is linked to real identities by kyc based services. We cant afford such security risks for Cyber citizens. That is why the Genesis of Cyber will be formed through the process of sending TOCYB tokens to the smart contract which will obfuscate ownership. All TOCYB tokens will be converted to CYB tokens 1-to-1. Amount of TOCYB tokens which have been send to Exodus will work as signaling for launching the Cyber network.

## Bootloading Tools

Starting from the first days the Cyber network have to be heavily loaded using the knowledge which is formed in Bostrom network. So we have to offer solid bootstrapping tools for that.

## The Gift

Activation of the portal is the experimental gift of BOOT tokens. Based on this experiment we are going to analyze results and improve the efficiency of the main gift of TOCYB tokens.

## Stability of Dependencies

The projects depends on the [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus and [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/. Currently this software has not been stabilized. Before launching Cyber we have to ensure stability of this dependency. 


## Genesis of Cyber

After all preparations will be completed we can launch the main network
