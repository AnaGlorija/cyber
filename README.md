# Protocol

The repo is a collection of mission critical information on the Cyber project. The purpose of the repo is to form both social and technical consensus' on the project. The technical consensus is more about having a protocol spec which is possible to implement in any language. The social consensus is more about the common vision aka shelling point for every involved party.

## Computing the knowledge of the Great Web

Is a [whitepaper](/computing-the-knowledge/computing-the-knowledge.md)  describing a protocol framework. Research focuses on establishing the most important concepts and its rationale.

## Story

Basic vision on how we are going to [grow the baby](/story/cyber-roadmap.md).

[Episode-1](/story/episode-1.md) is also ready
